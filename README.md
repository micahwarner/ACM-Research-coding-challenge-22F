# Micah Warner ACM Research Coding Challenge Fall 2022
### Solution Description:
Going into this challenge, the only programming languages I knew were Java, C#, javascript, css, and HTML, and I didn't know how to implement datasets into any of these languages. I've always heard that python is a very useful language to know, so I took this challenge as an opportunity to learn some python and implementing and using datasets with it. 

##### Starting Simple
Other than wanting learning python and datasets, I didn't really have any other idea on what to do, so I just started coding and trying different things. I started out simple and just made the dataset into an array, and then made a new array containing each model of car without any repeats and a new array that contained the amount of each model of car in the respective index. 
##### Finding Qualities
After that, I thought about what are a couple of the main things people care about when buying a car, and decided to focus on the year the car was made and the total mileage. I made two functions that used the arrays I had previously made that found and printed the year the newest car of a model was made and the car that had the lowest amount of mileage. 
##### Making Graphs
Lastly, I started to learn about plotting graphs using data using matplotlib. I made two functions, one for colors and the other for models, that get 50 random cars from the data and checks if the color or type has already been added to the graph, and if it is it adds to the amount, otherwise it adds a new tick on the graph. At the end of the two functions, it labels the graphs and adds the information, and then plots it all and makes two bar graphs.
